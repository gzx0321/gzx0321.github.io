title: "The Macro Impacts of Investment Debt-Inflation Channel on Investment"

excerpt: "This paper evaluates the macro impact of the debt-inflation (Fisher) channel of investment,  whereby unexpected inflation erodes the real value of nominal debt and thus stimulates firm-level investment. Consistent with theory, I document that more indebted firms increase investment more relative to others following unexpected increase in inflation. To quantify the macro effect of this channel, I develop a general equilibrium model with heterogeneous firms, financial frictions and nominal debt contracts.  I show that a 1% unexpected inflation raises aggregate investment by 0.8%. By applying the observed post-COVID inflation surprises, this firm-side Fisher channel is quantitatively important enough to explain about 70% investment surge. This finding highlights a significant transmission mechanism for investment, in contrast to previous studies that found a more modest role for the Fisher channel on household consumption."
