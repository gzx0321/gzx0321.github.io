title: "The Macro Impacts of Debt-Inflation Channel"
collection: publications
category: jmp
permalink: /publication/jmp
excerpt: "This paper quantitatively evaluates the macro impact of the debt-inflation channel of investment, whereby unexpected inflation erodes the real value of nominal debt and thus stimulates firm-level investment. Using Compustat data, I document pronounced heterogeneity: following unexpected inflation, more indebted firms increase investment relative to less-indebted peers; this pattern is robust across alternative measures of indebtedness and specifications. To quantify the macro effect of this channel, I develop a general equilibrium model with heterogeneous firms, financial frictions and nominal debt contracts. I show that a 1% unexpected inflation raises investment by 0.8%."
