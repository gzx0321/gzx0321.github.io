excerpt: 'This paper examines labor share dynamics following economic recessions using quarterly firm-level data from Compustat (1996-2022). I construct a novel dataset combining Compustat financial data with BLS industry-level wages and employ a comprehensive decomposition framework. I document that aggregate labor share exhibits sharp, permanent drops after each recession, driven by two mechanisms: (1) accelerated declines in the unweighted average labor share among surviving firms during and after recessions, and (2) persistent negative contributions from firm reallocation, particularly through "Rising Star" firms that gain market share while reducing labor share. Regression analysis confirms that conditional on time trends, the unweighted mean shows significant post-recession discontinuities of approximately 1.5 percentage points across three major downturns. Counterfactual exercises suggest these recession-period adjustments account for part of the aggregate decline. These findings contribute to understanding the role of business cycle dynamics in labor share evolution.'
